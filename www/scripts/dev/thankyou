//Hey, you found it!

//This is an easter egg flag that shows you're good at enumerating the website! So bravo.

//Or, you just looked through the source code on the github page. But still, that's a great skill to have! Enumerating the website by source code review is a fantastic way to find bugs.

//In any case, a huge thank you goes out to HackerOne (Jenn and Ben, thank you guys!), and Tom from VetSec for giving me the opportunity to put this together. I had a blast and I hope you enjoyed and learned something.

//Thank you for playing! Now get out there and Hack All the Things!
